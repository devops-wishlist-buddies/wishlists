# Wishlists

This repo is for the Wishlists squad in DevOps Fall 2021 class.

## Development process

1. Select an issue from the top of the "Sprint Backlog" column on the board, assign it to yourself, and move into the In Progress column (you can always put it back)
2. On your machine create a new branch naming it following the format `{issue number}__{summary-of-what-youre-doing}`
3. Implement requested features and tests
4. Commit your changes. Keep commit messages informative, whould be really great if you prepend the commit message with the issue number.
5. Push local branch to remote, and create a pull request to `main` branch. Add everyone else as reviewers. Move the issue to the "Review" column
6. When there is at least one approval on your pull request, have someone else merge your changes (the idea here is to have several pairs of eyes on the code to avoid mistakes). Then move your issue to the "Done" column.
6. Success!
